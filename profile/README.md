**e280** is our wip elite buildercore dev cult.  
we forge tools in the fire of real work.  
we ship open source software.  

a talent pool of dedicated monks who can build anything and cannot be stopped.  
an academy for inspired acolytes, confined to the lesser discord channels until they earn their place.  
we recognize true builders. no talkers. no wannabes.  
right now, we're quietly building our first releases to prove our own worthiness.  

founded by [@chase-moskal](https://github.com/chase-moskal) and [@zenkyuv](https://github.com/zenkyuv).
